        <h2>Legitimate Reasons for Processing Your Personal Information</h2>

        <h2>Removal of Data</h2>
        <p><strong>Automatic removal:</strong> Stored data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server.</p>
